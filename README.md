## Systematic_Review (CUP)
### Introduction
<div align="justify">
Cancer of Unknown Primary (CUP) describes a heterogeneous group of cancers characterized by the presence of metastatic disease with an unidentified primary tumor despite thorough diagnostic efforts. The elusive nature of CUP poses significant clinical and socioeconomic challenges, complicating optimal treatment strategies and leaving both patients and clinicians uncertain of the best course of action. Consequently, the long-term prognosis of these patients is impacted.
  
Much like the CUP clinical workflow, research on cancer of unknown primary involves significant ambiguity, making it challenging for researchers to understand the current state of knowledge, the path that led to this point, and future prospects in the field. This comprehensive review aims to provide a valuable resource for researchers, offering clarity and insight to aid in navigating the complexities of CUP and facilitate future research.

### Project Description
<div align="justify">
This project presents the most comprehensive systematic review of CUP imaging research to date, systematically covering studies from the early days of medical imaging up to August 2024. Our review spans a broad array of imaging modalities—historical, current, and emerging—and examines their diagnostic applications for CUP. After screening approximately 5,000 articles, we have included data from more than 200 studies, synthesizing the findings into a detailed narrative summary.


### Repository description
<div align="justify">
This repository contains <code>Python</code> scripts that supported various stages of the project, from screening titles and abstracts, retrieving full-version articles, organizing downloaded records for quality assessment and data extraction, to creating data visualizations and graphics. These tools streamline each step, enabling efficient data management and presentation.
